    <h2>Who am I, in this World?</h2>
      <p>These past few months as a third-year student have been very 
        challenging for me. I don't know why, but this year and semester 
        have been the most difficult for me. Many things have happened 
        that make me question myself, like the recurring question in my mind, 
        'Am I on the right path in my life and course?' or even asking myself, 
        'Do I really belong to the IT course?.
      </p>
        <p>I've encountered a lot of breakdowns and felt so lost in the past 
          few months, wondering if I truly suit or fit into this world. 
          However, I guess I should also be thankful because now I am 
          able to see and feel the glimpse of reality after being a
          student. I've realized that my life doesn't end after I graduate;
          it's just the start of the journey of my life. But to be honest, 
          even right now, as a third-year student, I can't help but feel 
          the pressure, asking questions like 'Can I even graduate in IT?' 
          or 'Will I be able to get a job aligned with what
          I've studied, which is IT?
      </p>
      <p> "Next year, it will already be 2024, and we'll be finishing 
          our first semester as third-year students. My only goal for the 
          next year is that the pressure and overwhelming feelings I am 
          experiencing right now will be more of a challenge than a reason
          to question myselfâ€”a challenge that I can overcome and one that 
          I will soon recall and refer to as a beautiful lesson in my life.
